Dear Quincy,
Thank you for the clarification.
We have servers at the following Kyndryl Datacenters managed by IBM:
1.	PD-Poughkeepsie, NY
2.	PD-Dallas, TX
Could you please confirm if these locations fall under the IBM East and West regions? Additionally, could you highlight the change process as practiced at IBM?
Thank you for your assistance.
Best regards,
[Marco
